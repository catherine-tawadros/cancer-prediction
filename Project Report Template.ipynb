    "As data science students seeking entry into the data science field post-graduation, we were interested in creating a robust regression model to predict salaries. Due to the increasing demand for professionals in this industry and its rapid growth, it is important, for employees and employers alike, that salaries are accurately predicted to ensure fair and competitive compensation."

    "Our aim was to develop a regression model to predict salaries in the data science field using information from different data science-related jobs all over the world. We created a regression model using different tuning techniques that can help ensure fair compensation for job seekers and aid organizations in attracting top talent by predicting salaries accurately. Our objective is to accurately estimate salaries, a continuous response variable, while optimizing Mean Absolute Error (MAE). "

    "Our main stakeholders for this project are current data scientists and machine learning practitioners along with job seekers in the data science space. For current data scientists, our predictions from salary data in the last three years can help them in making career decisions and negotiate salaries with their employers. For job seekers, our predictions can inform them so that they can appropriately evaluate their job offers and generally be aware of the future trajectory of specific subcategories in the Data Science & Machine Learning industry (compensation-wise), so that they can target their applications better. Other stakeholders for this project include the companies in the DS & ML space themselves, who can be informed through our predictions to effectively set competitive salary ranges. They can attract top talent by tailoring their compensation packages. Lastly, our insights are useful for universities and educational institutions interested in assessing the Return on Investment (ROI) of their data science programs and attract more candidates, as well as researchers, who can use our predictions to drive further research to assess industry growth in the data science field."

    "We decided to create individual base models using MARS, Decision Trees (with cost-complexity pruning), Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. We then ensemble these models using voting and stacking regressor methods to see whether this would help reduce the bias and/or variance of our model, while optimizing our metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE). \n",
    "We decided to optimize MAE, to allow for a balanced approach, while reducing both overestimation and underestimation errors. Additionally, MAE is more practical than Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in real-world scenarios as it helps stakeholders interpret the model's predictions directly, since MAE is in the same units as the target variable. For our dataset, the standard deviation of the response variable (salary in USD) is $63,605. \n",
    "We anticipated that the column names for job titles would be a problem since there is no standardized job title for our data set. To solve this problem, we decided to bin the original job titles into 10 main categories to enable more generalized conclusions and improve the interpretability of our findings. While doing EDA, we also encountered the problem of evaluating the differences between using the work year column as a feature to predict the salary or to perform a time-series analysis, which would entail predicting salaries for future work years using historical data. Although a time-series analysis would provide insights into future salary trends, it would require more advanced modeling techniques beyond the scope of the class.\n",
    "By choosing the work year as a feature, we can still capture important trends in our data while maintaining the feasibility of implementing our regression models within the confines of our current study. This approach enables us to develop accurate salary predictions without the additional complexities introduced by time-series modeling.\n"
